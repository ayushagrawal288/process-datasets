Implement a system which processes a dataset based on some config.

- input dataset may be csv, excel, etc
- output should be csv files stored on disk (ignore any data casting issues)
- interface to code/logic should be simple
    - adding new datasets shouldnt require writing a lot of code
    - triggering refresh should be 1 function call
    - fetching stored data should be 1 function call
- you may truncate the existing data and load fresh data during each refresh. no need to handle updates.

What we will be evaluating:
    - object oriented code
    - use of external libraries where appropriate
    - conformance to existing standards for code style like pep8
    - any additional features you add on top of the list above

You may zip and email me your solution (code + requirements.txt).
